# rlife
A life library written in Rust.

It is a library that aims at manipulating life cellular automata grids.
For now it supports:
* toroidal and resizable grids
* loading and saving files containing grid data
* stepping forward the generations of a grid (if it is a resizable grid, it will make sure the pattern is always at the center of the grid)
